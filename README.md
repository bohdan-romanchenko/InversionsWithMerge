With decomposition method an algorithm that would solve the following
task.

* Incoming data. D matrix of integers dimension UxM, where u - those of users, m -the number of films. Each element of the matrix D [i, j] indicates the position j in the movie list User preferences i. Another element is the input x - user number, which will be comparable all other users.

* Output data. List of ordered ascending second element pairs (i, c), where i - number
user, c - a number that indicates the degree of similarity and preferences of users x c (number
inversions).
